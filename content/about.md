My name is `Im Saesin` (alias : LeiMath). I am currently a student.

This website is a collection of Scholarship Math Problems, Articles and my Notes. Ocassionally stumbling into Olympiad Math Problems and Mathematical Curiosities.

Beyond Mathematics, I have dabbled into Theoretical Computer Science, Music Theory as well as Playwriting among all things. I sketch sometimes. 

I frequent in competitive programming websites, in particular - Atcoder. I have been also into CTF Challenges to some extent as well.
