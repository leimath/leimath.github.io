A <code>tour</code> of a graph $G$ is a closed (starts and ends in same vertex) walk that traverses each edge of $G$ <strong>at least</strong> once.
If a cycle in a graph traverses every edge of the graph <strong>exactly</strong> once then the cycle is termed as <code>Euler Tour</code> (old books also call it <code>Euler Trail</code> as well).
A graph where Euler tour is admitted is called a <code>Eulerian Graph</code>.</p><p>A <code>path</code> is any walk (or, chain) with distinct vertices.</p><hr><h1 id=theorems>Theorems<a href=#theorems class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p><code>Theorem 1</code>: A finite graph $G$ is a chain or a cycle if and only if $G$ is connected and the number of vertices with odd degree in $G$ is equal to $2$ or $0$. When and only when the number of vertices with odd degrees in $G$ is equal to $0$, the connected graph $G$ is a cycle.</p><p><code>Theorem 2</code>: If $G$ is a connected graph and has $2k$ odd vertices, then graph $G$ can be drawn by lifting one&rsquo;s pen $k$ times and at least $k$ times.</p><p><code>Theorem 3</code>: A nonempty connected graph is Eulerian if and only if it has
no vertices of odd degree.</p><p><code>Theorem 4</code>: A connected graph has an Euler trail if and only if it has at
most two vertices of odd-degree</p><p>Note: Some theorems are quite tricky, especially Theorem 1, and non-intuitive. Please refer to the book mentioned above for proofs else, skip them.</p><p><code>Theorem 5["Euler Path Theorem"]</code>:</p><ol><li>A graph contains a closed Euler path if and only if</li></ol><ul><li>Every vertex has even degree, and</li><li>All edges are in the same component.</li></ul><ol start=2><li>A graph contains an open Euler path if and only if
(a) Exactly two vertices have odd degree, and
(b) All edges are in the same component.</li></ol><p>Note: An Euler path is called <code>closed</code> if it starts and ends at the same
vertex; otherwise it’s called <code>open</code>.</p><hr><h1 id=tactics>Tactics<a href=#tactics class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>Along with previously discussed tactics, some extra ones are:</p><ul><li><code>Coloring</code>: We try to divide the graph into subgraphs and see if keep some color invariant results in some concrete evaluation of data given in the question paired with the theorems presented above.</li><li><code>Principle of Least Action</code>: We try to generate a tour which requires the least <em>weightage</em> (weightage can mean the degree value, moves set or any other restriction) and then try to see at cases which either maximize or minimize some condition respectively.</li></ul><hr><h1 id=questions>Questions<a href=#questions class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p><code>1.</code> Arrange $n$ vertices $v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n}$ in order on a line. Each vertex is colored in red or blue. If the ends of a segment $v_{i} v_{i+1}$ are colored differently, we call it a standard segment. Suppose the colors of $v_{1}$ and $v_{n}$ are different. Prove that the number of the standard segments is odd.</p><p><code>2.</code> [CMC 5th] A graph which consists of a convex $n$-polygon and $n-3$ disjoint diagonal lines in the polygon is called a subdivision graph.
Prove that there exists a <code>subdivision graph</code> which is a cycle drawn without lifting one&rsquo;s pen (i. e. start from a vertex, go through each segment only once and return the starting point) if and only if $3 \mid n$.</p><p><code>3.</code> On an $8 \times 8$ chessboard with 64 black and white squares we move a knight. In whatever direction the knight moves, is it possible to make the knight move to all the squares and each square only once? (A knight moves from a corner square of a rectangle with $2 \times 3$ black and white squares to another corner square diagonal to the starting position.)</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://leimath.github.io/posts/gt-notes-p6/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
