<p>This is the sixth part of the graph theory notes. We take a look at Hamiltonian Graphs. We omit a tactics section since the questions related to Hamiltonian Graphs are diverse each requiring some approach unique in its own way, please see the <strong>#Questions</strong> section for further references.</p>
<p>The book followed throughout is: <em>Graph Theory with Applications</em> by <em>Bondy J.A., Murty U.S.R.</em>. Please refer to the book for examples as well as visual graph drawings.</p>

<p>If a chain exists such that it passes through <strong>every</strong> vertex only once, then the chain is called a <code>Hamiltonian Chain</code>, respectively the definition also follows similarly for <code>Hamiltonian Cycles</code>. Put differently, a Hamiltonian chain is where it visits every vertex
exactly once but need not cover every edge. If a graph contains a Hamiltonian <strong><em>cycle</em></strong> then the graph is called a <code>Hamiltonian Graph</code>.</p>
<p>Note that no nontrivial necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be Hamiltonian is known, it is one of the main unsolved problem of graph theory. However, there are some negative tests, which can show that a given
graph contains no Hamilton path or cycle, and some positive tests, which can show that
a given graph contains a Hamilton path or cycle without actually constructing one. These
tests do not apply to every graph.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEOGcSCTar8">this</a> to get a idea on the differences in the Eulerian Graph and Hamiltonian Graphs. Loosely, Eulerian graphs only bother with edges whereas a Hamiltonian graph has to deal with the vertices.</p>
<h1 id=theorems>Theorems<a href=#theorems class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p><code>Theorem 1</code>: In a bigraph $G$ if $|V_1| \neq |V_2|$, $G$ must contain no Hamiltonian cycle. If the difference between $|V_1|$ and $|V_2|$ is more than $1$, $G$ must contain no Hamiltonian chain.</p>
<p><code>Theorem 2</code>: Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n \geqslant 3$ vertices. For every pair of vertices $v,v'$ if $$d(v) + d(v') \geqslant n - 1$$ then $G$ contains a Hamiltonian chain.</p>
<p>Note that the Theorem 2 condition is indeed gives a way for existence of a Hamiltonian chain but it is not necessary. There exists examples (e.g, a regular hexagon) where the condition fails yet the graph is a Hamiltonian chain.</p>
<p><code>Theorem 3[Ore]</code>: Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. For every two nonadjacent vertices $v,v'$ if $$d(v) + d(v') \geqslant n$$ then $G$ is a Hamiltonian cycle.</p>
<p><code>Theorem 4[Dirac]</code>: Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. If the degree of every vertex $v$ is no less than $\frac{n}{2}$, then $G$ must contain a Hamiltonian cycle.</p>
<p><code>Theorem 5[Pósa]</code> Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices, where $n \geq 3$, and suppose that the degrees in $G$ satisfy $$d_{1}>1 ~ ,~ d_{2}>2~,~ \ldots ~, ~ d_{i}>i$$ where $d_1,d_2, \ldots, d_i$ represents the degrees of each vertex for all values of $i &lt; \frac{n}{2}$.
Then $G$ contains a Hamilton cycle.</p>
<p>This is the so called <code>Pósa's theorem</code>, and in a way &ndash; the combined power form of Theorem 3 and 4.</p>
<p>$$\dotsb$$</p>
<p><code>Theorem 6</code>: If $G$ contains a Hamiltonian graph, remove several vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3, \ldots v_k$ and their adjacent edges from $G$ to get new graph $G^\prime$, then the number of connected components in $G^\prime$ is no more than $k$.</p>

<h1 id=questions>Questions<a href=#questions class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>A lot of different variants of questions are possible and simply listing down tactics wouldn&rsquo;t cover the strategies usually required, hence we recommend the reader to do questions from any standard book (either from the one mentioned at the begining of this post, or <em>Graph Theory: A Problem Oriented Approach by Daniel Marcus, Chapter G</em>) along with the questions presented below.</p>
<p><code>1.</code> Arrange 7 examinations in 7 days so that the two courses which are taught by one teacher cannot be arranged in two consecutive days. If every teacher can teach at most 4 courses which have examination. Prove that it is possible to arrange the examinations in the above way.</p>
<p><code>2.</code> A factory produces two-color paper using 6 distinct colored yarns. Among six kinds of yarns, every color must be matched in groups with three other colors. Prove that it is possible to choose three kinds of two-color paper so that all 6 colors are present.</p>
<p><code>3.</code> If $A_{0} A_{1} A_{2} \ldots A_{2 n-1}$ is a regular polygon of $2 n$ sides. Join all its diagonals to get a graph $G$. Prove that every Hamiltonian cycle of $G$ must contain two edges which are parallel in the graph.</p>
<p><code>4.</code> An executive has $2 n$ friends, among whom there are several friends hate each other. But the number of persons every friend hates is no more than $n-1$. Can they sit in a round table so that no two adjacent friend hate each other?</p>
<p><code>5.</code> Around a table there sit at least five persons and it is possible to rearrange their seats so that beside everyone there are two new neighbours.</p>
