# About

My name is `Im Saesin` (alias : LeiMath) and this is my blog. I am currently a student.

This website is a collection of Scholarship Math Problems, Articles and my Notes. Ocassionally stumbling into Olympiad Math Problems and Mathematical Curiosities. I am very interested in the works and life of Pierre de Fermat.

Beyond Mathematics, I have dabbled into Theoretical Computer Science, Music Theory as well as Playwriting among all things. I sketch sometimes. 

I frequent in competitive programming websites, in particular - Atcoder. I have been also into CTF Challenges to some extent as well. 

â˜… A complete list of all the posts _yearwise_ can be found in the [Listing](https://leimath.github.io/listing/) page.

Theme is [terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) provided by [panr](https://github.com/panr) built on [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
