If we attach some directional information to an edge, then the graph is called a <code>directed</code> graph. Let the directional information be represented by an arrow which points <em>to</em> a vertex <em>from</em> another vertex, the <em>from</em> side has the arrow and is called an <code>arc</code> in literature. If there is an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$ then the pair is represented as $(v_i,v_j)$ and the order is fixed. A directed graph is represented as $G = (V,U)$ where the $V$ stands for the usual vertex set and $U$ stands for the arc set composed of directed pairs like $(v_i,v_j)$ etc if an arc exists. The directed graph also follow the <em>simple</em> nature.</p><p>The number of arcs which have the starting point from $v_i$ have a name, <code>outdegree</code> represented by $d^{\star}(v_i)$. Similarly the number of arcs whose arrow points to $v_i$ also have a name, <code>indegree</code> represented by $d^{\circ}(v)$.</p><p>We call a directed graph a <code>tournament</code> if the graph contains $n$ vertices and there is only one arc joining every two vertices. We denote the directed graph by $\overline{K_n}$.</p><p>In a directed graph $D = (V,U)$ let there exist distinct arcs $u_i$. If the starting point of $u_i$ is $v_i$ and endpoint of $u_i$ is $v_{i+1}$ for $i \in \lbrace 1,2,3, \ldots , n \rbrace $ then $n$ is called the length of the directed path from $v_1$ to $v_{n+1}$, and if $v_1 = v_{n+1}$ then this path is called a circuit.</p><hr><h1 id=theorems>Theorems<a href=#theorems class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p><code>Theorem 1</code>: Let $v_i$ be the vertices of a tournament $\overline{K_n}$ for $i \in \lbrace 1,2,3, \ldots \rbrace$ then, $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n d^{\star}(v_k) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^n d^{\circ}(v_k) = \frac{1}{2} n (n-1)$$</p><p><code>Theorem 2</code>: There exists a vertex in a tournament so that there is a path from it to any other vertices. The maximum length of the paths is 2.</p><p><code>Theorem 3</code>: If the vertex of $\overline{K_n}$ with maximum outdegree is unique, then this outdegree is $n-1$.</p><p><code>Theorem 4</code>: Tournament $\overline{K_n}$ contains a Hamiltonian path whose length is $n-1$.</p><p><code>Theorem 5</code>: The tournament $\overline{K_n}$ for $n \geqslant 3$ contains a circuit which is a triangle, if and only if there are two vertices $v,v^{\prime}$ which satisfy $$d^{\star}(v) = d^{\circ}(v^{\prime})$$</p><hr><h1 id=questions>Questions<a href=#questions class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p><code>1.</code> Prove that if a tournament $\overline{K_n}$ contains a circuit, then $\overline{K_n} contains a triangular circuit.</p><p><code>2.</code> There are $100$ species of insects.

there is one species who can eliminate another species. (But A
eliminates B, B eliminates C, which does not mean that A eliminates
C . ) Prove that the $100$ species of insects can be arranged in an order so
that any species can perish another species next to it.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://leimath.github.io/posts/rational-appr/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
