&lt;h1 id="k-partite-graphs">$k$-partite Graphs&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Let $G$ be a graph with with the vertex set $V$ then if&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The vertex set can be decomposed into a union of $k$ subsets such that any two subsets are disjoint i.e $$V = \bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^k V_i \qquad V_i \cap V_j = \phi$$ for some $i \neq j$&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no edge whose two vertices are in the same subset&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>then if these two conditions are met, we call a graph &lt;code>k-partite&lt;/code>. A 2-partite graph is called a &lt;code>bigraph&lt;/code>. A $k$-partite graph is denoted by $G = (V_1,V_2,\dots,V_k;E)$ or $G = (V_1^k;E)$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not difficult to convince oneself that any graph with $n$ vertices is $n$-partite graph.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose that $G^\prime$ is a &lt;em>simple&lt;/em> $k$-partite graph as in $G^\prime = (V_1^k;E)$ with $| V_i| = m_i$, $i \in \lbrace 1,2,3, \ldots \rbrace$. The graph is said to be &lt;code>complete k-partite&lt;/code> if &lt;strong>any&lt;/strong> two vertices belonging in two different subsets of the vertex set $V^\prime$ are adjacent, i.e, $u \in V_i , v \in V_j , i \neq j$ and $u$ is adjacent to $v$. We denote the graph $G^\prime$ as $K_{m_1, m_2, \dots , m_k}$ and more frequent notation is $T_{k}(n)$ where $n$ stands for the total number of vertices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A complete bigraph is shown below, denoted as $K_{2,3}$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./img/complete-bigraph.png" alt="A complete bigraph">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Complete bigraphs do not contain triangles made with the vertices of the graph itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h1 id="theorems">Theorems&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Theorem 1&lt;/code>: If a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices contains no triangle, the largest number of edges of $G$ is $\left[\frac{n^2}{4}\right]$ where $\left [ .\right]$ represents the greatest integer function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hint: Prove by Induction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$\dotsb$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Theorem 2 [Tur치n]&lt;/code>: Suppose $G$ contains no $K_{m+1}$, then $e(G) \leqslant e(T_{k}(n))$. The equality holds if and only if $G \cong T_{k}(n)$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key: The $\cong$ represents &amp;lsquo;isomorphic&amp;rsquo;. The $e(.)$ stands for the number of edges. $G$ is any simple graph. $T_{k}(n)$ represents a complete $k$-partite graph with $n$ vertices. $K_{m+1}$ is the complete graph with $m+1$ vertices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proof can be found in the book &lt;em>Graph Theory with Applications&lt;/em> by &lt;em>Bondy J.A., Murty U.S.R.&lt;/em> as was mentioned in Part 1 of these notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note 1: This theorem&amp;rsquo;s proof is not necessary for olympiads/scholarship exams. Theorem 1 is rather common and is sometimes referred to Tur치n&amp;rsquo;s theorem as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note 2: $e(T_k(n)) = \binom{n - k}{2} + (m-1)\binom{k+1}{2}$ where $k = \lfloor \frac{n}{m} \rfloor$&lt;/p>

Degree of a Vertex The degree of a vertex $v$ in a graph $G$, denoted by $d_G(v)$ (or simply, $d(v)$ if the context of graph is clear), is the number of edges incident ot $v$ of $G$. Each loop is counted as two edges.</description><content>&lt;p>The book followed throughout is: &lt;em>Graph Theory with Applications&lt;/em> by &lt;em>Bondy J.A., Murty U.S.R.&lt;/em>.

&lt;h1 id="degree-of-a-vertex">Degree of a Vertex&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>degree&lt;/code> of a vertex $v$ in a graph $G$, denoted by $d_G(v)$ (or simply, $d(v)$ if the context of graph is clear), is the number of edges incident ot $v$ of $G$. Each loop is counted as two edges. $\delta(G)$ and $\Delta(G)$ are used to represent the minimum and maximum degrees of the vertices of $G$ respectively. A vertex is odd if the degree is odd, else it is even.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let $G(V,E)$ be a graph where $V,E$ are the vertex and edge set respectively. If it happens that for ALL vertex $v$, $d(v) = k$ for some $k$, then the graph $G$ is called &lt;code>k-regular&lt;/code>. The complete graph on $n$ vertices is $(n-1)$ regular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Theorem[I]: For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the sum of degrees of all the vertices is twice as large as the number of edges. In symbols, if the $n$ vertices are $V = \lbrace v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \rbrace$ then $$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^n d(v_k) = 2 |E|$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is popularly known as the &lt;code>Hand-Shaking Lemma&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Theorem[II]: In any &lt;em>finite&lt;/em> graph $G$, the number of vertices with odd degree is even.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Theorem[III]: A vertex is at most adjacent to other $n-1$ vertices in a simple graph on $n$ vertices i.e $$d(v) \leqslant n-1$$ for all $v \in V.$&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Let there be $n$ vertices of type $x$ all contained in the set $X$ i.e, $X = \lbrace x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \rbrace$ and $m$ vertices of type $y$ in $Y$ as $Y = \lbrace y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m\rbrace$ then $X \cap Y = \phi$ and if we connect $x_i$ with $y_i$ if a relationship exists then an edge $(x_i, y_i)$ is formed. This graph $G$ is called a &lt;code>bipartite&lt;/code> graph, or &lt;code>even&lt;/code> graph and is denoted by $G = (X,Y; E)$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If $G$ is a simple graph on $n$ vertices, then if we generate a graph by deleting all the edges belonging to $G$ from the complete graph $K_n$, this is called the &lt;code>complementary&lt;/code> graph of G, denoted by $\bar{G}$.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Following the tradition of this blog, we do not present any illustrations on using the tactics as it limits the readers to thinking about the problems only through a specific approach whereas in an exam environment multiple approaches and various combination of techniques is necessary.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;h1 id="graphs">Graphs&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A graph is a set of points with certain vertices joined by some edge. The graph represents a binary relationship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When to look through a Graph Theoritic perspective ? Whenever there is a clear-cut distinction provided in the question as some &amp;ldquo;objects&amp;rdquo; and some &amp;ldquo;relationship&amp;rdquo; between the objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To represent such objects, we use a point and call it &amp;ldquo;vertex&amp;rdquo; and to signify the relationship between two vertex, we draw a line between them and call it an &amp;ldquo;edge&amp;rdquo;. Whatever figure this generates, we call it a graph.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We present the proper definition just for the sake of completeness.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Graph[Definition]: A graph is a triplet $(V,E,\varphi)$ where $V$ and $E$ are two disjoint sets, $V$ is non-empty and $\varphi$ is a mapping from $V \times V \to E.$ The set $V$ is the vertex set, $E$ is called the edge set an $\varphi$ is the incidence function.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Rules for Graphs:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>$\qquad$ [I] It is allowed that vertices and edges may not be in the same plane&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$\qquad$ [II] It is NOT allowed for an edge to pass through a third vertex&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$\qquad$ [III] It is NOT allowed for an edge to intersect itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>For two graphs $G_1, G_2$ if there exists a bijection between the vertices of $G_1$ to $G_2$ such that the number of edges joining two points in $G_1$ equals the number the edges joining two in $G_2$, then we call such two graphs $G_1, G_2$ as &lt;code>isomorphic&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a graph $G_0$ and $G_1$, if it is so that vertex and edge of $G_0$ is a subset of vertex and edge of $G_1$ then $G_0$ is called a &lt;code>subgraph&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two points are &lt;code>adjacent&lt;/code> if there is a edge joining them. A vertex is &lt;code>incident&lt;/code> to edge if the vertex is the end of the edge. A vertex which has a edge joining itself to itself is called a &lt;code>loop&lt;/code>. Two edges with same pair of vertex are called &lt;code>parallel&lt;/code>. A graph is &lt;code>simple&lt;/code> if it has no loops or parallel edges. A &lt;code>complete&lt;/code> graph is a graph in which &lt;em>every&lt;/em> two point are adjacent i.e they have a edge between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If $n$ is the number of vertices of a graph, the total number of possible edges (or, number of edges in a complete graph) are $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{1}{2} n(n-1).$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A graph is &lt;code>finite&lt;/code> if cardinality of vertices and edges are finite. If a graph has infinitely many vertices OR edges, then it is &lt;code>infinite&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$\star$ Generally, unless stated otherwise - we use &lt;em>finite&lt;/em> graphs all throughout these notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h1 id="tactics">Tactics&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A wide variety of questions can be tackled merely by the above definitions. The tactics to solve such problems are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Reformulate the question&lt;/code> : This sounds simple enough but not always clicks to mind by a first look. After translating the question in graph theoritic terms and &lt;strong>constructing a graph&lt;/strong>, a few too many questions are tremendously simplified to some form of logical argument or something to do with the data provided/inferred.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Parity&lt;/code> : Somehow reach contradictions with even-odd arguments. Works best if the question already provides some concrete data on some variable bein even/odd.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Coloring&lt;/code> : Usually works great when some form of trait is to be deonstrated among $2 + k$ objects. Then the problem can be reduced to showing monochromatic structure among these $2+k$ objects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Pigeonhole principle&lt;/code> : If we put $n$ pigeons in less than $n$ pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole contains more than one pigeons. Simple enough to state, but it might take a while to frame the question to use this, the most apt use case is when paired with the above mention &amp;ldquo;coloring&amp;rdquo; strategy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Neighborhood Dragging&lt;/code> : We consider the neighbourhood (denoted by the set $N$) of two defined objects, or vertex (in the question) and then argue if a foreign object can be in it or not (usually depends on the question for partculars).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>WLOG vertex&lt;/code> : In some instances where the graph isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly defined well, we might WLOG assume a pair of vertex or an edge to exist.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h1 id="questions">Questions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;code>1.&lt;/code> There are 50001 people in a party. Suppose that each of them shakes hands with at least one person. Prove that there must be someone who shakes hands with at least two persons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>2.&lt;/code> There are $n$ athelete who attend a meeting. For any four athelete, there is one person who has shaked hands with the other three.
Prove that for any four athelete, there must be one person who
shakes hands with the rest of the $n - 1$ athelete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>3.&lt;/code> [USAMO 1978] Nine mathematicians meet at an international mathematics conference. For any three persons, at least two of them can have a talk in the same language. If each mathematician can speak at most three languages, prove that at least three mathematicians can have a talk in the same language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>4.&lt;/code> There are $n$ fruit boxes. Any two fruit box have the
same kind of fruit inside and every kind of fruit is contained
in just two fruit boxes. How many kinds of fruit are there?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>5.&lt;/code> In a bus with any $m$ travellers, $m \geqslant 3$, they have only one common friend. If $A$ is friends with $B$ then $B$ is friends with $A$, anyone is not a friend of ownself. How many people are there in the carriage ?&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Only use parity if it is &lt;strong>VERY&lt;/strong> obvious that some variable is odd or even from the start. Assumptions might lead to false conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Prime Case&lt;/code>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Given equation has some variable as a prime ? Try two cases if the prime equals $2$ or is an odd prime. Is there some important clue that can be obtained from the prime equals $2$ case or the odd prime case ?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>$$\dotsb$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Factorization&lt;/code>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Factor the given equation and see if one of the sides can be broken (especially, if it is a constant) to deduce some conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Sophie Germain Identity: If of the form $a^4 + 4b^4$ then factor as $((a+b)^2 +
b^2)((a-b)^2+b^2)$ or the regular version $(a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab)(a^2 + 2b^2-2ab).$&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>SFFT : If of the form $xy +x +y$ or $\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{N}$ see - &lt;a href="https://studymath.github.io/assets/docs/SFFT.pdf">Click Here!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ then $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>$$\dotsb$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Monotonicity&lt;/code>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Using the fact that $f(x) = x^2$ is monotonous over $\mathbb{Z}^+$, we can deduce things like $a^2 &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; (a+3)^2 \implies x = (a+1)^2$ or $x = (a+2)^2.$ The idea being between two squares, there is another square in between if the original two squares differ by some constant.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There is a $x$ in the power of every constant in the equation ? Take the R.H.S and divide both sides by it, the R.H.S should be $1$ now. Now observe the increasing-decreasing arguments and employ them on this equation to get contradictions or soem useful clue like parity.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Some theorems that are of use if the given equation is assumed to be $f(x)$:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>$\qquad$ [I] If the function $y = f(x)$ is continuously increasing or decreasing
in set $I$, then the equation $f(x)= 0$ has at most one solution in $I.$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$\qquad$ [II] If the function $y=f(x)$ is increasing (decreasing) over interval $I$, then the function $y=-f(x)$ is decreasing (increasing) on $I$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$\qquad$ [III] The sum of two increasing functions is an increasing function and the sum of two decreasing functions is a decreasing function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$\qquad$ [IV] If one of the two functions $f$ and $g$ is increasing and the other is a decreasing function of real variable $x$, then the equation $f(x)=g(x)$ has at most one real zero.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$\dotsb$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Bounding&lt;/code>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Given equation is symmetric ? Using symmetry (if the equation looks &amp;ldquo;evenly&amp;rdquo; divided or, if the equation variables can be rotated and no change occurs) we take a WLOG inequality and then try to bound at least one variabe to generate further cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Is the graph simple to visualize ? Try to figure out the graph and extremal points.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Is the maximum and minimum readily available ? Try to use them as bounds&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Need to show that no integer solutions exist ? Modular Arithmetic.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Euler&amp;rsquo;s Harrow: It can be tricky deciding what modulo to use for unconventional powers hence a useful clue might be using Euler&amp;rsquo;s Theorem that $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1$ $\operatorname{mod} n$ when $\operatorname{gcd}(a,n) = 1$ and working modulo $n$ hereon. Specifically, we check try to find such a $n$ so that Euler&amp;rsquo;s theorem holds (it makes the RHS under mod $n$ &amp;ndash; one) and we do this by first observing the highest power of the given equation (say, $m$) and coming up with $\phi(n) = m.$&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Given two equations and both have variables ? Try to write it in the form of a modular equation $f(x) \equiv 0$ $(\operatorname{mod} g(x))$ and try to eliminate the variable and get a constant $k$ to get something like $g(x) \mid k$. This implies $g(x) \leq k$ so we can check finitely many such $k$ that might be valid.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Equation has a square ? Try modulo 3,4,5,8 and 16.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Equation has a cube ? Try modulo 7,9,13.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Squares can only be congruent to 0, 1 or 4 modulo 8.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>$$\dotsb$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Quadratic Discriminant&lt;/code>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Given a quadratic and Integer solutions are involved ? Try obtaining the discriminant. Now for integer solutions, the discriminant &lt;strong>MUST&lt;/strong> be perfect square hence we keep chaining discriminants (if the subsequent discriminant is also a quadratic) and lastly assume it to be equal to some $k^2$. In the last step if it happens that with some manipulation the equation is factor-able, and there lies a constant we can check the factors of the constant as such. The last step might vary as it can be that sometimes, instead of factoring we get another quadratic so we take its discriminant and again equate to some $m^2$ and check similarly. Sometimes we might also need modular arithmetic or parity arguments as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>$$\dotsb$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Variabe Cuts&lt;/code>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Question asks to show infinite number of solutions ? Try reducing the number of variables as much as possible with substitutions (and very rarely, by modular arithmetic) to end up with a dependency on a tertiary variable which can take any value.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Standard substitutions include ($x+s, x, x-s$) or ($x-s,x+s$). The key idea is to cancel out when substituting and if some factorable form is present - then to exploit that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>$$\dotsb$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>G.C.D Linking&lt;/code>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This involves the fact that if $\operatorname{gcd}(a,b) = d$ then $a = pd$ and $b = qd$ for some $p,q.$ This susbstitutions might lead to some manage-able divisibility assumptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If the gcd happens to be $1$ then a few many clues can be found from the equation by the substitutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>$$\dotsb$$&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The listed methods are enough for most questions at the Scholarship level. Olympiad students should look into methods such as &lt;em>Infinite Descent, Zsigmondy&amp;rsquo;s Theorem, Cyclotomic Recognition&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Viete Jumping&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some instances, more tools like &lt;em>Lifting the Exponent Lemma&lt;/em> and &lt;em>p-adic observations&lt;/em> are elso employed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, it is also advised to add &lt;em>Legendre&amp;rsquo;s/ de-Polignac Formula&lt;/em> and more generally p-adic valuations (2-adic, to be more specific) in the toolkit, they help in some instances as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="theorems">Theorems&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Theorem[Zeckendorf]: Every positive integer can be represented &lt;code>uniquely&lt;/code> as the sum of one or more Fibonacci numbers in such a way that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Theorem[Counting]:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>$F_{n}$ is the number of binary sequences of length $n-2$ with no consecutive 0 s.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>$F_{n}$ is the number of subsets of ${1,2, \ldots, n-2}$ that do not contain any pair of consecutive numbers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Theorem: All the odd divisors of Fibonacci numbers with odd subscripts are of
the form $4t + 1$&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h1 id="the-proof-of-a-theorem">The Proof of a Theorem&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Theorem: Let $r \in \mathbb{N}$. The Fibonacci numbers modulo $r$ form a periodic sequence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Proof:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The total number of possible pairs $\left(F_{i} \bmod r, F_{i+1} \bmod r\right)$ is $r^{2}$. Therefore some ordered pair must occur more than once, so pick one that repeats and label it $n$ and $n+j$; that is,
$$
\left(F_{n} \bmod r, F_{n+1} \bmod r\right)=\left(F_{n+j} \bmod r, F_{n+j+1} \bmod r\right) .
$$
Then induction on $k \geq 2$ and using the recurrence for the Fibonacci numbers show that $F_{n+k} \bmod r=F_{n+k+j} \bmod r$. Therefore the sequence $F_{n} \bmod r$ is periodic. $\blacksquare$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This above theorem while may or may not be useful, has seen usage because of the proof. The idea of finite pairs of remainders and that eventually some remainder of index values will repeat has been used in question based on divisibility sequences.&lt;/p>
