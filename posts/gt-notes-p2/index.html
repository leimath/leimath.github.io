Each loop is counted as two edges. $\delta(G)$ and $\Delta(G)$ are used to represent the minimum and maximum degrees of the vertices of $G$ respectively. A vertex is odd if the degree is odd, else it is even.</p><p>Let $G(V,E)$ be a graph where $V,E$ are the vertex and edge set respectively. If it happens that for ALL vertex $v$, $d(v) = k$ for some $k$, then the graph $G$ is called <code>k-regular</code>. The complete graph on $n$ vertices is $(n-1)$ regular.</p><hr><h1 id=theorems>Theorems<a href=#theorems class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>Theorem[I]: For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the sum of degrees of all the vertices is twice as large as the number of edges. In symbols, if the $n$ vertices are $V = \lbrace v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \rbrace$ then $$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^n d(v_k) = 2 |E|$$</p><p>This is popularly known as the <code>Hand-Shaking Lemma</code>.</p><p>Theorem[II]: In any <em>finite</em> graph $G$, the number of vertices with odd degree is even.</p><p>Theorem[III]: A vertex is at most adjacent to other $n-1$ vertices in a simple graph on $n$ vertices i.e $$d(v) \leqslant n-1$$ for all $v \in V.$</p><hr><p>Let there be $n$ vertices of type $x$ all contained in the set $X$ i.e, $X = \lbrace x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \rbrace$ and $m$ vertices of type $y$ in $Y$ as $Y = \lbrace y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m\rbrace$ then $X \cap Y = \phi$ and if we connect $x_i$ with $y_i$ if a relationship exists then an edge $(x_i, y_i)$ is formed. This graph $G$ is called a <code>bipartite</code> graph, or <code>even</code> graph and is denoted by $G = (X,Y; E)$</p><p>If $G$ is a simple graph on $n$ vertices, then if we generate a graph by deleting all the edges belonging to $G$ from the complete graph $K_n$, this is called the <code>complementary</code> graph of G, denoted by $\bar{G}$.
The complement of the graph with $n$ vertices and no edges is the complete graph on $n$ vertices, and is denoted $K_{n}$.</p><hr><h1 id=tactics>Tactics<a href=#tactics class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><ul><li>Looking for some contradiction with the use of Hand-Shaking Lemma.</li><li>Selectively looking for what the degree of a vertex value can be.</li><li>Looking at the subgraph by deleting some edges, vertices and then reaching some contradiction.</li><li>Getting bounds on the degree of all vertex values.</li><li>Viewing $d(v)$ as some algebraic object to use inequalities in it.</li></ul><hr><h1 id=questions>Questions<a href=#questions class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p><code>1.</code> Show that at any party, there are always at least two people with exactly the
